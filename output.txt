Finding Deadlocks in a Dump file
Printing out sample tests instead of unit tests to keep the demonstration simple, yet cover the basics.

Testing: CYCLIC THREADS
compute() called from Thread: A
compute() called from Thread: C
compute() called from Thread: B
compute() called from Thread: D
Threads involved in deadlock [D, B, A, C]

Testing: 1 THREAD
compute() called from Thread: A
Threads involved in deadlock null

Testing: 2 LOCKS 2 THREADS
compute() called from Thread: A
compute() called from Thread: B
Threads involved in deadlock [A, B]

Testing: ACYCLIC THREADS
compute() called from Thread: B
compute() called from Thread: A
compute() called from Thread: D
compute() called from Thread: C
Threads involved in deadlock null
